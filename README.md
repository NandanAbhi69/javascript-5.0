what is javascript and why we use it?

-javacsritpt is logic based programing language where we can create our project funcctionality in that.
-javacsript is a high level programing language for buildweb pages.
-Now we used the ES6(echma script 6) version of javascript, in other words we called vanila javascript.
-runtime envirnment of javascript is node js.

VARIABLE:-
-Variable is a container to store some data.
-In js we have three type of variables 
1.let:-
-Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later .
-Now these days ,most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
-Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.

2.var:-
-Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
-Var is used in browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the time.
-
3.const:-
-const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
-const means constant to store some data like numbers,iteger etc..

TASK-
1.DIFF btwn let and var.
2.Diff btwn var & const.
3.What do you mean by haisting(when we donn't decla.re value of variable but it execute the code).

RULES OF VARIABLE:-
-Variable names are case sensative "a" & "A" is different.
-Only letter ,digit,underscore & $ are allowed(not even space).
-only letter ,underscore or $ should be 1st character.
-Reserve words cannot be variable names.

DATA TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT:-
-Data type is a attribute associated with a piece of data that tells acomputer system how to interprets its value.
-Mainly in js their are 2 types of data type-
1.primitive:-
 -In js there are 7 types of primitive data type.
 1.Number:-number are the type of data  type those it contain some numerical value.
 2.String:-string is a type of data type that can hold some characterlike names....
 3.Boolean:-Inboolean data type we get Boolean value like true,false.
 4.Undefined:-IN undefined data type the data is not define so that it will show undefined.
 5.Null:-In this data type we get null for the value means nothing.
 6.Bigint:-In Bigint we will get big integer.
 7.Symbol:-In Symbol we get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type.

2.Non-primitive or Reference:-
  -Non-primitive data type are the type of data type that can hold multiple items in a single time .
  -Non-primitive data types are -object,array,function.

object:-
  -object is a non-primitive data types which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
  -Mainly objects are working on (key;value)pair.
  -The left side is our keys and right hand side are the values of following object.

   ex-
   deepak={
   college :"GIET";
   address :"BBSR";
   age :50;
   salary:45000;
   carrier :"good"
   }

OPERATORS IN JS:-
 -Operators are the key todo some of task or operate so,e task.
 -ex=A+B
 -In the above example A & B are the operands ,'+' is the operators to do the addition.

  -ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:-
   -(+,-,*,/)
   modulus = %
   Exponential = **
   2. unary operator:-
   Increment = ++
   Decrement = --
   3. Assignment operator :- (assign some value to the variables)
   (=, +=, -=, %=, **=)
   4. Comparison operator :- (compair the values)
        equal to -> ==
        not equal to -> !=
        equal to & type -> ===
        not equal to & type -> !==
        (>, >=, <, <=)

    5. Logical Operator :- checks the logic of the operator(true/false)
       Logical AND &&
       table of AND operator is :-
       cond 1, cond 2, res (&&)
       T + T = T
       T + F = F
       F + T = F
       F + F = F
       Logical OR ||
       Table of OR operator is :-
       cond 1, cond 2, res (||)
       T + T = T
       T + F = T
       F + T = T
       F + F = F
       Logical NOT !

conditional statement :-

- to implement some condition in the code.
- there are 3 types of conditional statements are there
1. if condition :-
    - if condition is true then statement is true otherwise false.
    syntax :-
    if(condition){
      statement
    }
2. if-else condition :-
    - if condition is true then block executed otherwise its terminate to else condition.
    syntax :-
    if(condition){
      statement
    }
3. else-is condition :-
   - It checks the condition multiple times where condition is true.
   syantax :-
   if(condition){
      statements;
   } else if(condtion){
      statements;
   } else{
      statements; 
   }
