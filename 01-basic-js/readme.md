Variable :-

- variable is container to store some data.
- in javascript we have 3 types of variables
  1. let :-
       - Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
       - Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
       - Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.
  2. var :-
      - Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
      - Var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the time.
  3. const :-
       - Const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
       - Const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc..
